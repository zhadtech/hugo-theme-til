# Today I Learned

A Hugo theme focused on simplicity and readability. Ideal for both traditional blog posts and shorter notes that makes
it easy to record and share knowledge that doesn’t need a full blog post. Perfect for quick tips, insights, and
discoveries.

Check out the theme demo at <https://michenriksen.com/til-example-site>.

## Features

### Content graph view

Visualize connections between notes and posts like seen in Apps like Obsidian. The content graph provides a web of your
knowledge, letting you and your readers explore related notes and see how everything connects.

### Side notes

Add side notes that sit neatly alongside your main content. Perfect for extra details, tips, or fun facts without
breaking up the flow of your writing.

### Admonitions

Highlight important notes, warnings, tips, or anything that deserves special attention with styled callout boxes. Great
for keeping readers informed.

### JSON-LD data

Automatically includes structured [JSON-LD] data for better SEO. This feature helps search engines understand your
content, making it easier for your posts to show up in relevant search results with rich snippets like author details,
dates, and more.

### Built-in blocking of generative AI/LLM associated web crawlers

Prevent web crawlers commonly used to train AI models from accessing your site. This feature protects your content from
being used in datasets for generative AI or large language models, helping you control who sees and uses your material.

## Configuration

in the `[params]` section of your site's [hugo.toml] configuration file.
